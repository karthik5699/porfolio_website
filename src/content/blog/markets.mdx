Markets or Financial markets are not a recent phenomenon, they have been around ever since the beginning of civilization when humans started to grow agricultural produce and trade them.

After a good harvest the early farmers would have decided to trade away their excess produce in exchange for other commodities. The exchange rate would again depend on the demand and supply of the commodity in the market.

Similarly, after a bad harvest those early farmers would have needed credit/loan to purchase seeds for the next season.

These decisions of farmers to trade, exchange and borrow constituted the first financial market. With time many financial products and services have entered the markets, but the core functions of financial markets have remained the same. 

Financial markets serve some of the basic functions in our economy like:

1. **Price discovery**: Price discovery is the process of determining the value of a given asset or commodity. Markets play a key role in price discovery. Markets facilitate price discovery by bringing buyers and sellers together and the price of the asset is adjusted after a consensus is reached between the traders.

2. **Asset Valuation**: Asset valuation is the process of measuring the fair or intrinsic value of an asset. While there are many financial models to calculate the fair value of an asset, market prices are considered the most accurate. Apart from that, market prices are useful for buying and selling businesses because there is a universal consensus on its price, which is difficult to achieve between opposite parties. 

3. **Arbitrage**: In countries with poorly developed financial markets, the pricing of the commodities and currencies may be different at different locations within the country. Traders attempt to profit from these price differences and as a consequence the prices start to become uniform within the economy, making the markets more efficient.

4. **Investing**: Financial markets provide everyone the opportunity to invest in assets like Stocks, Bonds and grow their capital in the long term. When you invest in a stock you become a part-owner of the company, and you grow your capital either by capital gains (increase in share price) or dividends (company’s share of cash flow with its shareholders).

5. **Risk Management**: Derivatives are incredibly important in the world of finance. Instruments like Futures, Options and other derivative contracts offer protection against many kinds of risks. Let us take the example of farming. There are many uncertainties in agriculture business including weather, yields, government regulations, global markets and other factors which can impact farmer’s income. To hedge against this uncertainty and practice risk management, farmers use derivative instruments.

## Conclusion

Financial Markets play an important role in the economy. They provide capital to the companies so they can grow, hire and invest. They offer capital to the government to build roads, schools, hospitals and other public infrastructure. As a result, playing a key role in the functioning of our economy.
